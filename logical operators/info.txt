When all the operations are done, at the end all the bits of registers are
affected by it, suppose in this example we are modifying the eax but
the al register give out the same value at the end of the execution,
which is a problem.

In order to solve this issue we are gonna use a mask, in this process
we are gonna use the "AND" operator with all the other bits who are not
required in this operation, by doing this the other bits remain 0 and
we get appropriate output.

We generally use hex here because its easier to apply the "AND" operator.
