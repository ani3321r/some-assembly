Shift is a very intersting operator used to shift a bit by left(SHL)
ot right(SHR)

Basically when we are shifting a bit by the right we are dividing the value
by 2, accordingly if we shift 2 times we are basically diving be 2 two times

0010 -> 0001 (right shift once), 2 -> 1 (in decimal)

0100 -> 0001 (right shift twice), 4 -> 1 (in decimal)


Similarly the shift left gives multiplication by 2

And for signed bits we use "SAR" and "SAL"

It is only for the purpose of doing multiplication and division
in a very fast way instead of applying MUL and DIV
