MUL - for multiplication of unsigned values
IMUL - for multiplication of signed values

the "a" register is the default for multiplication
so we don't have to give two operands for MUL instruction
like in case of add or sub. The mul takes the value in the register
given and multiplies to the value in "a" register.

when we multiply a very big value, the al register expands to
ax register to fit the value(only happens in case of unsigned version)
