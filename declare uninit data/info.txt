bss is used for reserving space in the memory
DB - Define byte
RESB - reserved byte

while using resb we can't directly initialize a data to the memory 
space, first we have to store it in a register and then move the 
register to the memory space

when add +1 to num we are moving an extra byte ahead in the 
memory

using the DUP keyword we are initializing the value repeteadly
i.e., here we are taking three instances of the value 2
