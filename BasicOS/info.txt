src file:
The "ORG" command tells the assembler to address everything
relative to the address given.

Every x86 processer 64bit, 32 bit always starts in a 16 bit
architechture in the start for backward compatibility.

The "HLT" command pauses the cpu until a interupt is made to
the system

Then we are creating a infinite loop using "JMP" so that the
it doesn't goes out of halt 

The "TIMES" operation just repeats the thing the number of times,
as we need the last two bytes of 512 in the memory to include the
end sequence we are subtracting the total memory needed in the whole
operation from 510 and repeating to go to end sequence


MAKEFIlE:
Here we are making a image and a bin file using the main asm
file in order to run the bootloader and we are finally using 
qemu to test it using the command:
make
qemu-system-i386 -fda build/main.img


For printing a message in bios:
ds -> start address of the data segment
es -> start address of the extra segment
ss -> start address of the stack

we are setting all to zero to get a consistent start point
sp -> stack pointer
LODSB -> loads single byte

in the print_loop part we are OR'ing al,al so that when
the string comes to an end returing 0, the loop will end
then we are jumping to done_print

0x0E -> Code used to print something to the screen
0x10 -> Video interupt
