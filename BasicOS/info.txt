src file:
The "ORG" command tells the assembler to address everything
relative to the address given.

Every x86 processer 64bit, 32 bit always starts in a 16 bit
architechture in the start for backward compatibility.

The "HLT" command pauses the cpu until a interupt is made to
the system

Then we are creating a infinite loop using "JMP" so that the
it doesn't goes out of halt 

The "TIMES" operation just repeats the thing the number of times,
as we need the last two bytes of 512 in the memory to include the
end sequence we are subtracting the total memory needed in the whole
operation from 510 and repeating to go to end sequence


MAKEFIlE:
Here we are making a image and a bin file using the main asm
file in order to run the bootloader and we are finally using 
qemu to test it using the command:
make
qemu-system-i386 -fda build/main.img

/**************************************************************/

For printing a message in bios:
ds -> start address of the data segment
es -> start address of the extra segment
ss -> start address of the stack

we are setting all to zero to get a consistent start point
sp -> stack pointer
LODSB -> loads single byte

in the print_loop part we are OR'ing al,al so that when
the string comes to an end returing 0, the loop will end
then we are jumping to done_print

0x0E -> Code used to print something to the screen
0x10 -> Video interupt

In the creation of a FAT12 Disk:
Here we are segregating the kernal with the bootloader first
having two new sections in the makefile for building both seperately.

Then to create a FAT12 Disk the commands in the floppy sections is
used, first of all we are building using the kernal and bootloader
then we are allocating 512byte block size 2880 times 1.4mb floppy
just filled with zeros.
Then mkfs(make filesystem) is used.

Basically in the kernal and bootloader files we have the same code
as the src/main.asm, but we have to do some changes in the header of
the bootloader/boot.asm file to be able to compatible with the FAT12.

Output after make:
nasm src/bootloader/boot.asm -f bin -o build/bootloader.bin
nasm src/kernal/main.asm -f bin -o build/kernal.bin
dd if=/dev/zero of=build/main.img bs=512 count=2880

Reading from disk in bios:
The interupt(INT 13) is used for reading disk sectors. According to the
INT 13 manual we are adding drive number, cylinder number, sector number,
pointer to buffer etc in the main function, and then made a disk_read
function to be called at the end of this portion.

In the disk_read we are pushing all the required registers to the stack
then calling the lba_to_chs to give the rest values of the INT 13.

in order to check for the disk read we have to make the build image
again and then open qemu in debug mode using:
qemu-system-i386 -boot c -m 256 -hda build/main.img -s -S

After that we have to open the hex editor(we are using jeex) to alter
some data in the disk then use gdb.
In gdb we have to first go to localhost:1234 which is default port for qemu
using:
target remote localhost:1234

In gdb we need to break at *0x7c00 which is start of program(use br)
we need to then continue and go upto the end of the last jump and break
there and again continue, then we need to view the data in the register
ebx, where the edited value will be found..
