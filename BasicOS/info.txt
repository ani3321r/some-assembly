src file:
The "ORG" command tells the assembler to address everything
relative to the address given.

Every x86 processer 64bit, 32 bit always starts in a 16 bit
architechture in the start for backward compatibility.

The "HLT" command pauses the cpu until a interupt is made to
the system

Then we are creating a infinite loop using "JMP" so that the
it doesn't goes out of halt 

The "TIMES" operation just repeats the thing the number of times,
as we need the last two bytes of 512 in the memory to include the
end sequence we are subtracting the total memory needed in the whole
operation from 510 and repeating to go to end sequence


MAKEFIlE:
Here we are making a image and a bin file using the main asm
file in order to run the bootloader and we are finally using 
qemu to test it using the command:
make
qemu-system-i386 -fda build/main.img
