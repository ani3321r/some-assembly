The registers are very precisous so we need to keep data in the 
stack.

The ebp is considered as a base pointer register, below it everything
is considered as the part of a function. we move ebp the value of esp
so that we can do every action refereing to the ebp.

Before returning we must pop the value of ebp so that the stack
pointers returns back to the "return value".
