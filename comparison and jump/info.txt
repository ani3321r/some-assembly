When we compare the value in two registers using the "CMP"
internally two registers are subtracted and the result is being
set to the eflags register, it basically checks if the value is
greater than less than or eqauals to zero.

Then we use the jumps to know weather the value is lesser,
greater, etc. For that we use "JL" operation, if its executed
value is moved to ecx for the program gets executed using the
"JMP"

JL -> only if the result is less
JLE -> jump less than or equal to
JE -> jump equals
JNE -> jump not equals
JG -> jump greater
JGE -> jump greater than or equal to
JZ -> jump if result is zero, basically "JE"
JNZ -> jump if result is non zero

JMP -> always executes no matter what
