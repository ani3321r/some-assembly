for working with 32 bits
eax, ebx, ecx, edx

for working with 16 bits
ax, bx, cx, dx

for working with 8 bits
al, ah, bl, bh, cl, ch, dl, dh

by storing bytes next to each other we can use the memory more
efficiently, in order to do so we must choose the right type of
register we are referencing to


when working with smaller numbers we must use the lower register
i.e, al, bl, cl, dl, which will lead to take less space overall

if we store the smaller values in the higher registers ah, bh, etc,
the value store in them will be alright but the overall register i.e,
eax, ebx, etc will be populated with a lot of bytes
