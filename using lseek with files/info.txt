Here we are reserving just 10 bytes as we are trying to read only
one line of the whole text file.

1st part:
In the first part of the main we are opening the file as usual using
the syscode "5".

2nd part:
syscode of lseek -> 19

SEEK_SET -> from the front of the file(front to end) -> 0
SEEK_CURR -> current location of the offset bytes -> 1
SEEK_END -> from the end of the file(end to front) -> 2

In the eax we store the syscode, ecx the number of bytes to seek,
and in edx the type of seek(0,1,2)

3rd part:
Here we are doing the usual read with syscode 3

Therefore the main work of lseek is to move to a particular
location of the file before reading.
