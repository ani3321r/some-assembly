Part 1:
We are moving 5 to eax to give the open instruction. Then we are
moving the pathname to ebx as usual.

In the ecx we are combining two instructions but using bitwise
addition, create is 0100 in octal and write is 01 in octal, we are
adding them and getting 0101 which we represent as 101o in the command.

In the edx register we are storing the permmission for the file
Read -> 400,
Write -> 200,
Execute -> 100
We are gonna "or" these values meaning add them and get 700o.

Part 2:
In the second part of the main we are storing 4 in ebx to give the
write instruction, then we are giving the buffer to write in the ecx
register and the number of bytes in the edx.

In the toWrite part we end using [0AH,0DH,"$"], it indicates a newline
character in assembly.
