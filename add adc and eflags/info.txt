the eflags register is a set of bits representing flags for each bit,
the flags represent the operation that just run

inside of eflags register
CF - carry flag
PF - parity flag (determines odd or even, sets 1 for odd)
AF - auxiliary carry flag (carry or borrow of 3rd bit)
ZF - zero flag
IF - interrupt enable flag

*change in parity can indicate an issue in transmitting data

operations
ADD - adds two value
ADC - adds two values with carry


in order to check the carry value we are taking the higher 8bit
