when the value is returned the value is being stored in the register
eax.

when running a external function we need to link the file in the
command for the compilation, such as:
gcc -no-pie -m32 filename.o filename.c -o filename

After compiling, running the file we get only the output in the
printf statement, to get the return value we need to echo out.
