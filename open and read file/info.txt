In the data section we are storing the filename then we are
reserving some bytes in the memory to read the file in the
bss section.

sys_open code -> 5
we are storing 5 in eax to give the instruction of opening
the file, then we are storing the filename in ebx and the flag
in ecx.

sys_read code -> 3
Here we are moving the value of eax to ebx, then we are storing
3 in eax to give the read instruction, then we are storing the
buffer in the ecx and the size of the memory to read in the edx.

Then to finally exit the program, the final portion is added.
