DD -> Define Double(32 bits size)
MOVSS -> SS stands for Scaler Single precision

For moving these values we use special registers like xmm
which go from 0 to 15(e.g : xmm0, xmm1...xmm15)

To get the value in the register in xmm0 in gdb:
p $xmm0.v4_float[0]

The IEEE floating point notion have some drawbacks that
it doesn't have enough precision to show decimal values 
properly.

That is why we must have precautions while using floating
point operation in low level languages.
