RET -> used to return value from a procedure
CALL -> used to call a procedure

esp -> register of the stack pointer

In the gdb after steping into the addTwo function, we are gonna
check the value stored in the esp register, what we can infer from
the address is that, it is taking the value from stack and poping it
off to the program counter.

Usually this is how exploits are made by taking control over the 
return address
