We call external functions using the "extern" keyword.

Instead of "start" we use "main" while calling c functions
because it is recognised by the gcc.

10 is the newline character, and 0 is the null terminater for
the string, also we use "%s". 

The "PUSH" function will take the data and push it into the stack..

In the main function we are pushing the two parameters of printf
function and then calling the printf function. After that we are
pushing the exit code and calling exit

To compile the ".o" file we have to give some flags in the gcc
command such as:
gcc -no-pie -m32 filename.o -o filename
